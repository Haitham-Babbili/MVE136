question 1, exam Monday 5 January 2015
(Solution):
when you take the expectation
n1= n
n2= m
E[Wi*Wj] = E [ (sum wn)(sum wm)]    ------ (do expand)
                = E [(w1 + w2 + . . . + wn)(w1 + w2 + . . . + wm)]
if m<n
                = E[W1W1] + E[W2W2] + . .  . +E[WmWm]  = m var(W)
if n<m

                 = E[W1W1] + E[W2W2] + . .  . +E[WnWn]  = n var(W)


so in general,    = min(m,n) var(w)
